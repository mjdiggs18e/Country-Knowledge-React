### Purpose

The reason for building this website was to learn about React Router and useState/useEffect. I was able to generate unique routes for each country based off it's name or abbreviation. I also wanted to experiment and try Framer Motion so I added a subtile scale effect onto the country cards.

### Features

- Search for any country in the world to learn about it
